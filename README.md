# Graph-Based Contour Extraction

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent image segmentation algorithm using **Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm**. It enables precise object selection with edge-aware contour tracing in an interactive GUI.

## Features

- **Graph-Based Segmentation**: Treats an image as a graph for contour extraction.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Finds optimal paths along object edges.
- **Customizable Weights**: Supports different edge-weighting methods.
- **Interactive GUI**: Developed using **Java Swing** for real-time selection.
- **Efficient Processing**: Uses a priority queue for fast computations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graph-based-segmentation.git
   ```
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA or another Java IDE.
3. Build and run the project.
